 We have made these icons available for you to incorporate them into your
 products under the Apache License Version 2.0. Feel free to remix and
 re-share these icons and documentation in your products. We'd love
 attribution in your app's about screen, but it's not required. The
 only thing we ask is that you not re-sell these icons.
Comment:
 These files come from Google's material design icon set. They were translated
 from SVG to Android vector graphics and for some icons, the color has been
 changed in the resulting file.
